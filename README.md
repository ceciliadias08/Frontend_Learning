Frontend Learning

This repository is a collection of hands-on front-end practice projects built while exploring HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript fundamentals.
Each sub-project focuses on different skills and techniques:

AZ Development Website: A multi-section corporate website showcasing responsive layout, semantic structure, and visual storytelling.

Multiplication Table Generator: A JavaScript-powered app demonstrating user input handling, DOM manipulation, and dynamic content generation.

Together, these projects highlight progressive learning in web design, responsive interfaces, and interactive programming, making this repo a solid snapshot of my growth as a front-end developer.
