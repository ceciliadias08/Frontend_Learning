Multiplication Table Generator

This project is a simple yet interactive web application that dynamically generates a multiplication table for any number entered by the user.
Built with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, it demonstrates key front-end development concepts, including:

User Input Handling: An input field accepts any integer, with real-time validation to ensure a valid number is provided.

Dynamic DOM Manipulation: JavaScript creates and updates <option> elements to display the full 1â€“10 multiplication table without reloading the page.

Responsive Layout: Clean and minimal styling for a straightforward, user-friendly interface.

This project highlights your ability to work with event-driven programming, loops, and DOM manipulation, making it a strong example of functional JavaScript in action.
